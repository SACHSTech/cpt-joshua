## Description of data
The data set that I have chosen is the steam hardware survey. It containes data of what percent share that a given graphics card, processor, core count, clock speed, or graphics api has of the computer steam users use. I however only used the data for the graphics card usage and cpu core count.

## Why I selected this data
I picked the steam hardware survey because I find the reaults of it intresting to look at and see what components other people are using in there computers. As well as compare the popular components to mine. The reason why the Jul 2020 survey was used rather then the more recent May 2021 survey is because I could not find any downloads for the more recent one.
